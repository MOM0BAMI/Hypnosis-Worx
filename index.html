            <img src="assets/img/Upwork Photo_Front 1-9155 copy.jpg" alt="Lara Bonetto" class="profile-pic mb-3">
            <p class="bio">Hello! I’m Lara, an accredited Master Hypnotherapist (non-clinical), Master Transformation Coach,
                and Master Life Coach, based in Northcliff, Gauteng, South Africa. Since 2016, I’ve had the privilege
                of helping clients from all over the world – both in person and through online sessions – transform
                their lives.
                My journey began as a Life Coach, and it reached new heights when I discovered the profound
                power of hypnosis. Becoming a Master Hypnotherapist was a pivotal moment and the results I’ve
                seen since have been nothing short of extraordinary, shattering boundaries and redefining
                possibilities. For clients who are open to working with hypnosis, I’ve found that it creates quicker,
                deeper, and more lasting results than coaching alone. It’s a powerful tool that truly accelerates
                change.
                Working with my clients is a dynamic and collaborative exchange of energy. I bring 100% focus,
                dedication, and expertise to guiding them, and I ask for their full commitment to achieving the
                changes they desire. Whether we’re addressing deep-seated challenges or fostering growth to move
                forward, success hinges on their willingness and dedication—a shared effort that drives
                transformative outcomes.
                I approach my work with precision and focus, but I also believe that transformation doesn’t have to
                be heavy or overly serious. Humor is a powerful ally in making the journey enjoyable and
                approachable. In our sessions, you’ll experience a balance: light-hearted, engaging conversations
                seamlessly paired with deep, meaningful work. The most common feedback I receive from my
                clients is how safe, supported, and &quot;held&quot; they feel during our time together—a true reflection of
                the nurturing environment I strive to create.
                What makes this work truly rewarding for me is witnessing the incredible transformations my clients
                achieve. Watching someone shift from deep anxiety to calm confidence, from fear and insecurity to
                embracing life with boldness, from confusion to clarity, or overcoming the hidden “monsters” of
                their subconscious is nothing short of inspiring. Seeing my clients reclaim their power, feel light and
                free, and step into the life they deserve fills me with gratitude and drives my passion every single
                day.
                I’m here to guide you through your own transformation, no matter where you’re starting from.
                Together, we’ll work towards your unique goals, be it clarity, calm or confidence, you’ve been
                seeking. Let’s make it happen!</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>MP (Businesswoman and mom)</strong></p>
            <p>I had struggled with my weight ever since my marriage to my now ex-husband, and I never understood why I couldn’t let it go. During my sessions with Lara, we uncovered something profound—I had been holding onto the weight because of my ex-husband’s toxic words. He used to threaten me, saying that if I looked too good or too trim & sexy, it meant I was being unfaithful or trying to overshadow him. It was a heartbreaking realization, but with Lara’s gentle guidance, I was able to release that burden. For the first time, I felt free to embrace my true self without fear or guilt. I’ve not only started losing weight but also gained a confidence I never knew I had. Working with Lara has been life-changing, and I can’t thank her enough for helping me lose all the excess kilo’s - and reclaim my power and my happiness!</p>

            <p><strong>Megan (Business professional, wife, and mom)</strong></p>
            <p>I had the privilege of finding Lara by chance online when searching for a hypnotherapist. She was warm and understanding from our first conversation together and I am so pleased that I gave this gift to myself and chose to have Lara support me along this journey. She is so natural in her manner and approach, making me feel trusted and held in this vulnerable space. I was most surprised at her ability to read into my descriptions of events and make connections that I had not thought of. I would highly recommend Lara if you are thinking of starting hypnotherapy! I honestly cannot believe the progress and change I felt in a relatively short time. Thank you Lara...this is not the last time our paths will cross.</p>

            <p>Since my sessions with you, I have felt much more calm and stable. It's a natural calmness I don’t think I’ve ever experienced in my life. I’m less exhausted. Focused and grounded and much more at peace with myself and the world around me. I’m no longer overwhelmed as before. I have so much gratitude to you for finally being able to function in a state of ease.</p>
